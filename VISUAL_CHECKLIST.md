## ‚ùå Common Issues to Check

### If Something Looks Wrong

**Background looks flat/black:**
- Check that all 3 gradient layers are rendering
- Verify alpha values are correct
- Look for CSS override issues

**Nav isn't blurry:**
- Browser may not support backdrop-filter
- Try in Chrome/Safari (best support)
- Check for -webkit- prefix

**Horizon arc too bright:**
- Violet alpha may be too high
- Check opacity value (should be 0.95)
- Verify mask is working

**Nav not darkening on scroll:**
- Check browser console for JS errors
- Verify ScrollHandler is loaded
- Check body class is toggling

**Buttons not glowing:**
- Check box-shadow values
- Verify gradient is rendering
- Look for CSS specificity issues

## ‚úÖ Final Visual Assessment

After checking all items above, the page should feel:

- [ ] **Sophisticated** - Not flashy, but clearly high-end
- [ ] **Deep** - Multiple layers create dimension
- [ ] **Subtle** - No single effect is obvious
- [ ] **Elegant** - Refined and polished
- [ ] **Modern** - Contemporary tech aesthetic
- [ ] **Professional** - Production-ready quality

### Overall Impression
The page should evoke:
- Trust (through clean design)
- Modernity (through gradients and blur)
- Clarity (through hierarchy)
- Quality (through refinement)

**If all checkboxes are marked, the implementation is pixel-perfect!** ‚ú®

## üé® Quick Tuning Guide

If you want to adjust the intensity of effects:

### Make More Subtle
```css
/* In globals.css */
:root {
  /* Reduce these alphas */
  --glass-bg: rgba(12, 14, 20, 0.45);  /* Was 0.55 */
}

/* In horizon-arc */
opacity: 0.85;  /* Was 0.95 */
```

### Make More Prominent
```css
/* In globals.css */
:root {
  /* Increase these alphas */
  --glass-bg: rgba(12, 14, 20, 0.70);  /* Was 0.55 */
}

/* In layered gradient violet layer */
rgba(122, 94, 255, 0.15) 0%  /* Was 0.10 */
```

### Adjust Glow Intensity
```css
/* In globals.css .glow-effect */
box-shadow: 0 0 24px rgba(122, 94, 255, 0.45);  /* Increase size & alpha */
```
